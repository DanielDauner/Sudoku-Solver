# Sudoku-Solver
Simple program that solves Sudokus via backpropagation. 

The program consists of two classes
- GUI.java: Graphical user interface to type in the numbers
- Sudoku.java: Stores the grid and solves the puzzle

The GUI is simple to use. Additional algorithms can be added.

Note: This project was created for fun during a rainy saturday afternoon. It is not perfect and has room for improvement.
